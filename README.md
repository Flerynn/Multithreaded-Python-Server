# File Transfer Python (Multithreading client)

I used these resources to construct the server and client code
- Client code [Socket Programming with Multi-threading in Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/socket-programming-multi-threading-python/).

- Server code [Multithreaded Socket Server in Python](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23828264/how-to-make-a-simple-multithreaded-socket-server-in-python-that-remembers-client).

- DES [Pydes](https://github.com/RobinDavid/pydes).

 I hope it would help someone learn transfer files through network.
